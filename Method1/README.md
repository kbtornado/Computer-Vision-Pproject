The Method1.ipynb notebook contains code that has been executed on two distinct datasets, encompassing all test images within each.
Due to the computationally intensive nature of the code, which requires a significant amount of CPU resources, 
the execution was carried out on a high-performance computer available in the university's laboratory. Utilizing multithreading,
the training and testing phases were completed within a timeframe of approximately three hours.

For demonstration purposes and to facilitate the evaluation process for instructors, the Method1_for_teacher_test.ipynb notebook has been prepared.
This streamlined version of the code returns results for a single image, providing a quick and efficient way to verify the methodology.
Instructors are welcome to conduct further tests by supplying different images to the code as desired.
